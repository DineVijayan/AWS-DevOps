VPC Pearring 
============
create a vpc

connect from pub machine to pvt machine create a file with name 'mykey.pem' in that file give the pvt key and use the below command

Command to connect from public machine to private machine in linux:-
-ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@"privateip of pvt machine"

for pearring the vpc ip have to be diff from one another vpc ip or else you will get a conflict error while pearing

after creating two vpc do the peering connection by using the acceptor and the requestor

asign the present vpc cidr value in another vpc route table->routes

asign the another vpc cidr value in present vpc route table->routes

assign the present sg id to the another region sg to perform ping

assign the another sg id to the present region sg to perform ping

Ping protocol --> ICMP //open in security group
