Taints and Toleration
=====================
Taint --> It acts at node level
Toleration --> It acts at pod level

Taint Effects:- NoSchedule --> Using this it will not delete the existing pod in the node and schedule the pod in the tainted node
                Prefer No Schedule --> This will create the tainted and non-tainted pod also
                No Execute --> This will delete the existing pod in the node and schedule the pod in the tainted node

-kubectl taint nodes 'instance ami id' app=devops:NoSchedule- //to untaint the node
