there are two types 
withpip --> will not automatically install the configuration file
withoutpip --> this will automatically install the configuration file -> Inventory file and ansible.cfg file.
               The file will be created in path /etc/ansible/ move the file to /home/ec2-user

Steps to do ansible
===================
downlord the pageant from google "downlord putty"
Add the private key in the pagent of the node
while login the Master machine dont give the prive key to login. Select the Auth in putty. select the Allow agent forwarding
Install the ansible in Master machine
In the inventory file give the Slave machine public or private key
give wget (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/stable-2.11/examples/ansible.cfg) to get the ansible.cfg file

Amazon linux epel command
=========================
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y

Install phython
===============
sudo yum install python-pip -y

Install the Ansible
===================
sudo yum install ansible
pip install ansible
sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -->Amazon linux machine and in amazon python package is already installed

ansible configuration path
==========================
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

inventory       = /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo_user        = root
host_key_checking = False

ansible inventory file path
===========================
/etc/ansible/hosts

Node1 ansible_host= 'IP_ADDRESS ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/newkey.pem

To check the connectivity in master to node
===========================================
ansible all -i hosts -m ping
ansible all -m ping

Adhoc command
=============
ansible all -i slave.txt -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed" -b //to install the httpd in all the node machines
ansible all -i slave.txt -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b //to start the httpd
ansible 'give the ip of specific node' -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed" //to install httpd in specific one node machine
ansible all -i slave.txt -m copy -a "src='give the master path want to copy' dest='give the node path to place the copied file'" -b// to copy the file from master to node

Playbook command --> playbook will be written in a yaml file
================
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:
       - name: i am going to install apache
         yum:
           name: httpd
           state: Installed
       
       - name: starting my apache
         service:
           name:httpd
           state: started

       - name: copy index.html
         copy:
           src: ./index.html
           dest: /var/www/html/index.html
           mode: '0777'

Playbook file in loop
=====================
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:
       - name: Install packaging one by one
         yum:
           name: "{{ item }}"
           state: present
         loop:
           - mysql
           - php
           - unzip
           - wget

Install jenkins with playbook
=============================
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:
       - name: Install jenkins
         yum_repository:
            name: jenkins 
            description: jenkins yum repo
            baseurl: enter the url
            gpgkey: enter the url

       - name: install java and jenkins
         yum:
            name: "{{ item }}"
            state: present
         loop:
            - java
            - jenkins

       - name: start jenkins
         service:
            name: jenkins
            state: started
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the yaml file in ansible command
=======================================
ansible-playbook -i hosts apache.yaml

Vault command
=============
ansible-vault create first.yaml //this will encrypt the file while creating
ansible-vault encrypt first.yaml //to encrypt the yaml file 
ansible-vault decrypt first.yaml
ansible-vault view first.yaml //to view the encrypted file
ansible-vault edit first.yaml //to edit the yaml file is encrypted
ansible-vault rekey first.yaml //to change the encryped password 

Roles Command
=============
sudo yum install tree -y
